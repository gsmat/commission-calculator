# Commission Calculator System

## ğŸ“Œ What is this?
This project is a **commission calculator system** for financial transactions such as:
- **Cash-in (deposit)**
- **Cash-out (withdrawal)**
- **Loan repayment**

Each transaction has rules for commission fees (percentage + min/max limits). The system:
- Reads transactions from a **CSV file**
- Calculates the correct commission for each transaction
- Allows filtering transactions (by date, user type, operation type)
- Includes unit tests to check rules and parsing logic

The goal is to have a **clean, extensible, testable structure** that can be easily extended with new commission types in the future.
